# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration

***Guvi-Zen_Capstone Project-02***

**Problem Statement**:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

**Project Work Flow**
1. **Data Extraction:** The Github repository for Phonepe Pulse has been cloned using python to fetch the data, and it was stored into local in suitable JSON format.

2. **Data Transformation:** Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, has been employed to manipulate and pre-process the data. This has included cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
 
3. **Database Creation and Data Insertion:** The transformed data has been inserted into a MySQL database by connecting through the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python and by using SQL commands.

4. **Streamlit Dashboard Creation:** An interactive and visually appealing dashboard was created using Python's Streamlit and Plotly libraries. Plotly's built-in geo map functions have been used to display the data on a map, and Streamlit has been utilized to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

5. **Data Retrival:** The "mysql-connector-python" library has been used to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. The data in the dataframe has been used to update the dashboard dynamically.
  
6. **Deployment:** The application was made user-friendly for gaining insights and to know information about their Phone Pe app usage and money transactions.
